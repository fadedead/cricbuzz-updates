        Commentary: B0$ Hello and welcome to the first T20I between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. This is a good platform for the hosts to have some good practice ahead of the World Cup which is a month away now. Zimbabwe haven't made the cut for the 20 team extravaganza and would be gutted. But they can prove a point or two with a win here. Bangladesh have had their share of problems in the shortest format. But time is ticking away very fast and they have these handful of games to iron out every possible flaw.

        Commentary: The average scores on this deck aren't on the higher side but expect some runs for sure as both teams would be eager to showcase their preparations. Bangladesh would be clear favorites coming into this series but as I said Zimbabwe can punch above their weights and can make this a keen contest. Onus will be on their senior players like Raza, Ervine and Williams to come to the party and perform.

Lovely timing on it despite the ball being hit off the cue-end of the bat. The bat face twisted a little upon impact as well

        Commentary:  Mahedi Hasan to Ervine, B0$ Bowled!! Flatter one, little turn, Ervine looked to defend it but the ball turned enough to hit the sticks. Little turn on it bit ut turned enough to beat the prod. Huge strike and the decision to start with a spinner has paid immediate dividends. He tossed it up, the batter lunged forward but missed the line of the delivery. Was a bowler's delight as it hit the top of off. B1$
